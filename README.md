# Project: Apply Lightweight Fine-Tuning to a Foundation Model

## 1. Prepare the Foundation Model
1. **Load a pretrained HF model:** Includes the relevant imports and loads a pretrained Hugging Face model that can be used for sequence classification

2. **Load and preprocess a dataset:** Includes the relevant imports and loads a Hugging Face dataset that can be used for sequence classification. Then includes relevant imports and loads a Hugging Face tokenizer that can be used to prepare the dataset. A subset of the full dataset may be used to reduce computational resources needed.

3. **Evaluate the pretrained model:** At least one classification metric is calculated using the dataset and pretrained model

## 2. Perform Lightweight Fine-Tuning
1. **Create a PEFT model:** Includes the relevant imports, initializes a Hugging Face PEFT config, and creates a PEFT model using that config

2. **Train the PEFT model:** The model is trained for at least one epoch using the PEFT model and dataset

3. **Save the PEFT model:** Fine-tuned parameters are saved to a separate directory. The saved weights directory should be in the same home directory as the notebook file.

## 3. Perform Inference Using the Fine-Tuned Model
1. **Load the saved PEFT model:** Includes the relevant imports then loads the saved PEFT model

2. **Evaluate the fine-tuned model:** Repeats the earlier evaluation process (same metric(s) and dataset) to compare the fine-tuned version to the original version of the model
